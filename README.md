## Features
- Installs NSP files and split NSPs from your SD card
- Installs NSP files over LAN from tools such as [ns-usbloader](https://github.com/developersu/ns-usbloader)
- Installs NSP files over the internet by supplying URLs
- Installs and manages the latest signature patches quickly and easily
- Based on [Adubbz Tinfoil](https://github.com/Adubbz/Tinfoil), and will continue to receive updates alongside it
- Uses [XorTroll's Plutonium](https://github.com/XorTroll/Plutonium) for a pretty graphical interface
- Just werks

## Why?
Because Goldleaf tends to not "Just werk". I wanted a *free software* solution that installs titles, looks pretty, and doesn't make me rip my hair out whenever I want to install a title on my Nintendo Switch. Awoo Installer does exactly that. It installs titles. That's it!
